Creating instructions for the robothor environment

**pers_instr_creation.py** : absolute garbage, personal implementation of trying to find a path between 2 points, does not use BFS or any serach so it has very very limited uses. **DO not** bother checking it out unless you want to burn your eyes.

**instr_template.py** : contains the backbone for creating a navigation sentence template.

**instr_creation.py** : the shortest path implementation function in the code is taken from https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uw7SmxUnLwn3Y6HcqqvEhHnyRJ0Jv8kb?usp=sharing. This file will automatically generate instructions for all the scenes available in the robothor environment.
